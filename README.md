# Magic Mushroom Picker


## Description
Mushroom Picker was one of my first React projects. In order to learn about state and props, I made this tiny game of chance where you randomly pick mushrooms in hopes of collecting them all, but be careful! There are a few poisonous mushrooms in the forest and even one that is deadly. Feeling lucky?
